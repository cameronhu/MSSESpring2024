    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data.\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel uncomfortable with this topic, **please contact your TA, the instructors, or reach out via the [Spring 2024 extenuating circumstances form](https://forms.gle/HFdpmHzBu1e7zcF2A).**"

We, therefore, need to split the training data into separate training and validation datasets. You will need this **validation data** to assess the performance of your classifier once you are finished training. Note that we set the seed (`random_state`) to 42.

If the $j$-th word in `words` is present at least once in the $i$-th email in `texts`, the output array should have a value of 1 at the position $(i, j)$. Otherwise, if the $j$-th word is not present in the $i$-th email, the value at $(i, j)$ should be 0.\n",

    "Create the bar chart above by comparing the proportion of spam and ham emails containing specific words. **Choose a set of 6 words other than those shown in the example.** These words should have different proportions for the two classes (i.e., noticeably different bar heights across spam and ham). Make sure only to consider emails from `train`. Your `words_in_texts` function from the previous part will be useful here. \n",

Even in the Spam emails, the most prevalent word only appears in about 10% of the spam emails, with multiple words appearing much less. Thus, the words chosen for feature engineering for emails may not be optimal and may not be the best for the distribution of emails in our dataset, given that they show such little prevalence in both Ham and Spam emails.
