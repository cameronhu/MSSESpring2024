    "\n",
    "First, let's extract the date and time from the `released_at` column in `msft_news_df`. Notice that the date and time are encoded in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<date>May 29 2012</date> <time>09:40:58</time>\n",
    "<date>May 18 2011</date> <time>22:42:40</time>\n",
    "<date>August 15 2012</date> <time>00:09:02</time>\n",
    "<date>July 1 2011</date> <time>22:12:37</time>\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to convert this to a `Timestamp` object that we can use more easily. However, for this assignment, we are going to use string manipulation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a regular expression that extracts the Month, Day, Year, Hour, Minute, and Second from the `msft_news_df[\"released_at\"]` column. You should create a new `DataFrame` called `dates` that contains:\n",
    "1. The same index as `msft_news_df` (`id`) and\n",
    "2. Column labels: `\"Month\"`, `\"Day\"`, `\"Year\"`, `\"Hour\"`, `\"Minute\"`, `\"Second\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, convert all numerical values (`\"Year\"`, `\"Day\"`, `\"Hour\"`, `\"Minute\"`, `\"Second\"`) to type `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** You should use the [`Series.str.extract`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.extract.html) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** Don't forget to use raw strings and capture groups. Copy the above example text into [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) to experiment with your regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 3:** It might be helpful to break this up into a couple of steps (e.g., first extract date values such as Month, Day, and Year and then extract time values such as Hour, Minute, and Second)."

    "Through the years 2010-2012, there was a large increase in the number of articles mentioning the company Apple. Facebook and Amazon also had a small increase over these years, but not nearly as much as Apple. Upon Googling Steve Jobs, he died in 2011, and presumably left a lot of turmoil or speculation about the company's future. Thus, it makes sense that the number of articles mentioning Apple skyrocketed. However, just because they were mentioned more times, this does not necessarily indicate a positive trend in Apple's performance. As I recall, a lot of articles questioned how the company would function in the future, and thus not all mentions were good mentions in this scenario"

    "In this section, we will continue building on our past analysis and specifically look at the **sentiment of each article** —— this will lead us to a much more direct and detailed understanding of how these articles can be used in different applications. **Sentiment analysis** is generally the computational task of classifying the emotions in a body of text as positively or negatively charged.\n"

DistilBERT is a neural network-based language model (a close relative to ChatGPT); we will use the model checkpoint specifically trained for sentiment analysis. These models are not in scope for Data 100, and we don't expect you to know how they work; take CS182: Neural Networks or Data 102: Data, Inference, and Decisions if you're interested in learning more. We are using them here to show how easy (and useful) these technologies have become.\n",
