While course staff is happy to help guide you with submitting your assignment ahead of the deadline, we will not respond to last-minute requests for assistance (TAs need to sleep, after all!).\n",

    "\n",
    "We understand that it is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run code, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",

    "**Important note: The local autograder tests will not be comprehensive. You can pass the automated tests in your notebook but still fail tests in the autograder.** Please be sure to check your results carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, unless we state otherwise, **do not use for loops or list comprehensions**. The majority of this assignment can be done using built-in commands in `pandas` and `NumPy`.  Our autograder isn't smart enough to check, but you're depriving yourself of key learning objectives if you write loops / comprehensions, and you also won't be ready for the midterm.\n",

    "Rather than the inspection scores, you find that the number of vowels present in the business `name` is a better indicator of how good the cake is when it comes to the shops in `cake_at_least_3`. Using the helper function `count_vowels` we have defined for you, sort all the cake shops in `cake_at_least_3` based on the number of vowels in the business's name in descending order. Then, return a **Python `list`** consisting of the top 2 **uniquely named** cake shops using this sorted `DataFrame`. You should break ties using alphabetical ordering.

    "The `.loc` accessor allows us to select a subset of data from the `cake_at_least_3` dataframe. If only given one parameter, the `.loc` accessor will assume that that parameter corresponds to the labels of rows to select. The `.loc` accessor can take a single label, a list or array of labels, or a slice of labels. In this scenario, we will pass in a series of labels, which is essentially an array of labels, that corresponds to the labels of the rows (the index labels, not the actual numerical index) that we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.groupby` function takes in a column as a parameter by which to organize the dataframe. It returns a `GroupBy` object, which cannot be visualized like a normal dataframe, but must instead have some aggregate function be performed on each grouped set to return a dataframe or series. In this case, we grouped by the `bid` column (business ID) of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we used the context-dependent accessor `[]`, which determines by context what subset of the data we wanted to retrieve (what rows, columns, or subset of rows/colummns). Here, we passed in the label of a column with `[\"score\"]`, indicating that we wanted only the inspection scores of for each group of business id's, and received a SeriesGroupBy object which contained only the scores for each group of business IDs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We called `.idxmax()` as the aggregate function over the GroupBy object of scores of the business IDs, which gives us the index label of the maximum of the series it is called on. In this case, because we called it as the aggregating function for the GroupBy object of scores of business IDs, it returns a series of the corresponding index label in `cake_at_least_3` of the highest score corresponding to each group of business IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a series of labels of indexes is passed to the `.loc[]` accessor, and is used to select from the `cake_at_least_3` dataframe a subset of cakeshops. Finally, `.head()` returns the first 5 rows of the new subset dataframe of `cake_at_least_3`.\n",

We group by bid, find the index label corresponding to the highest score for each bid, and then filter the `cake_at_least_3` dataframe to only show those inspections (the highest-scored inspection for each unique BID with at least 3 inspections).\n"

    "Let's see which restaurant location has had the most extreme improvement in its scores. Let the \"swing\" of a restaurant location be defined as the difference between its highest-ever and lowest-ever score. **Only consider restaurant locations with at least 3 scores—that is, restaurants that were rated at least 3 times.** Assign `max_swing` to the name of the restaurant that has the maximum swing. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have not provided any skeleton, as there are many paths to getting the correct answer. The recommended approach to solving this problem is to break it down into smaller chunks (e.g., first, ensure all restaurants have at least 3 scores; second, compute the swing, etc.). This will likely require more than one line, so feel free to add/remove columns and define new temporary variables. Remember to assign your solution - a string containing the `name` of the restaurant location that experienced the most extreme improvement - to `max_swing` after you do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The \"swing\" is of a specific restaurant location. There might be some restaurants with multiple locations; we are focusing on the swing of a particular restaurant as specified by its `name` and `address`."
